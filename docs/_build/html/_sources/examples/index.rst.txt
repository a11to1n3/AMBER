Examples
========

This section describes the comprehensive examples demonstrating various features and use cases of AMBER. All examples are available as Python scripts in the ``examples/`` directory for direct execution.

Getting Started Examples
-------------------------

**Wealth Transfer Model**
   A classic agent-based model demonstrating wealth redistribution dynamics. Agents randomly exchange money, leading to emergent wealth inequality patterns.
   
   - Script: ``examples/wealth_transfer.py``

**Segregation Model**
   Implementation of Schelling's segregation model showing how individual preferences can lead to population-level segregation patterns.
   
   - Script: ``examples/segregation_model.py``

Advanced Examples
-----------------

**Virus Spread Simulation**
   Epidemiological model simulating disease spread through a population with different intervention strategies.
   
   - Script: ``examples/virus_spread_simulation.py``

**Forest Fire Model**
   Cellular automaton model of wildfire spread with environmental factors and firefighting interventions.
   
   - Script: ``examples/forest_fire_simulation.py``

**Flocking Simulation**
   Boids-style flocking behavior demonstrating emergent collective motion from simple local rules.
   
   - Script: ``examples/flocking_simulation.py``

**Button Network Simulation**
   Network-based model exploring information diffusion and social influence in connected populations.
   
   - Script: ``examples/button_network_simulation.py``

Interactive Examples
--------------------

**Interactive Wealth Transfer**
   Enhanced version of the wealth transfer model with interactive controls and real-time visualization.
   
   - Script: ``examples/interactive_wealth_transfer.py``

Running the Examples
--------------------

**Python Scripts**

All examples are available as standalone Python scripts in the ``examples/`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd examples
   python wealth_transfer.py

**Requirements**

Some examples may require additional dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter

**Example Structure**

Each Python script is self-contained and includes:

- Model definition and setup
- Simulation execution
- Data analysis and visualization
- Clear comments explaining the logic

Learning Path
-------------

We recommend following this sequence for learning AMBER:

1. **Start with Wealth Transfer** - Learn basic model structure and agent interactions
2. **Try Segregation Model** - Understand spatial environments and agent movement  
3. **Explore Virus Spread** - See how to model state changes and interventions
4. **Advanced Models** - Forest fire, flocking, and network models for complex behaviors
5. **Interactive Examples** - Learn about real-time visualization and user interaction

Each example builds on concepts from previous ones while introducing new features and techniques.

Source Code
-----------

All example source code can be found in the project repository under the ``examples/`` directory. The examples are designed to be:

- **Educational** - Clear, well-commented code that teaches AMBER concepts
- **Runnable** - Complete scripts that work out of the box
- **Extensible** - Easy to modify and build upon for your own projects
